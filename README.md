# Christiane Nanette Dragvik

üëã Hello! I'm Christiane, a dedicated and motivated frontend developer with a unique background in healthcare.

## About Me

My journey in healthcare exposed me to the transformative power of technology in improving patient care, igniting my passion for web development.

Currently, I'm on the verge of completing my studies in frontend development at Noroff. Through this program, I've honed my skills in web design and development, mastering frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and utilizing version control with Git and GitHub. My education has instilled a keen sense of project planning, responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and delivering exceptional user interfaces and experiences.

## What Sets Me Apart

What sets me apart is my extensive experience in home healthcare. I've developed strong competencies in problem-solving, effective communication, and seamless interdisciplinary collaboration. In critical, high-pressure situations, I've led cross-functional teams to address urgent needs, showcasing my ability to navigate unpredictable circumstances with clear communication and quick decision-making. I strongly believe that these skills make me an ideal candidate for roles that require working closely with other team members. 

## Always Learning

As a self-motivated learner, I embrace new challenges with enthusiasm.
