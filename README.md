# Christiane Nanette Dragvik

üëã Hello! I'm Christiane, a dedicated and motivated frontend developer with a unique background in healthcare.

## About Me

- üíª Skills: JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, and more.
- üè¢ Work: Currently working as a Social Educator at Asker Kommune.
- üéì Education: Bachelor in Social Education & (almost finished) Higher Professional Degree in Frontend Development.

My journey in healthcare exposed me to the transformative power of technology in improving patient care, igniting my passion for web development.

Currently, I'm on the verge of completing my studies in frontend development at Noroff. Through this program, I've honed my skills in web design and development, mastering frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and utilizing version control with Git and GitHub. My education has instilled a keen sense of project planning, responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and delivering exceptional user interfaces and experiences.

## What Sets Me Apart

What sets me apart is my extensive experience in home healthcare. I've developed strong competencies in problem-solving, effective communication, and seamless interdisciplinary collaboration. In critical, high-pressure situations, I've led cross-functional teams to address urgent needs, showcasing my ability to navigate unpredictable circumstances with clear communication and quick decision-making. I strongly believe that these skills make me an ideal candidate for roles that require working closely with other team members. 

## My Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

1. ([Holidaze](https://github.com/cdragvik/holidaze)) - My last exam project during my studies: a user-centric accommodation booking application offering a dual-platform experience: a customer interface for easy holiday bookings, and an admin interface for managing venue listings and reservations.
2. ([Fine Wine Auction ](https://github.com/cdragvik/semester-project-2)) - This website is an online wine auction platform, where users can buy and sell wine items through bidding, with a focus on user registration, credit management, and auction listing.
3. ([One Stop Shop ](https://github.com/cdragvik/eCom-store)) - This project involves building an e-commerce website with features such as product listings, individual product pages, a shopping cart, checkout process, and contact form, using React and React Router, with a focus on responsive design and clean code.

## Always Learning

As a self-motivated learner, I embrace new challenges with enthusiasm.

## Fun Facts

- When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the mountains with my family.
- I love late summer evenings with good food and company. 
- I'm a DIY enthusiast with a passion for remodeling. I've already tackled two house renovations and am currently working on my third. From design to construction, I love turning houses into homes!
