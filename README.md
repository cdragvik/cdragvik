### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated and motivated aspiring frontend-developer with a background in healthcare. Currently, I am in the process of completing my studies in frontend-development at Noroff while simultaneously working as a social educator/nurse in Asker Kommune. My experience in the fast-paced and unpredictable environment of home nursing service has enabled me to develop highly valuable skills in problem-solving, communication and teamwork. I strongly believe that these skills make me an ideal candidate for roles that require working closely with other team members. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a deep interest in user experience and accessible design, and I am enthusiastic about continuously expanding my knowledge in these areas and development in general. I am highly motivated to take on new challenges and leverage my healthcare and technical knowledge to thrive in my career transition to frontend-development.
